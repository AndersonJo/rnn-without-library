# rnn-without-library
The repository shows several RNN examples with or without Library (or contribution code). <br>
All examples predict sin graph. 

# Examples

| File | Model | Library | Description |
|:-----|:------|:--------|:------------|
| **01_rnn_keras** | Synced RNN | Keras | |
| **02_rnn_tensorflow** | Synced RNN | Tensorflow | It does not use contrib library |
| **03_rnn_tensorflow** | Synced RNN | Tensorflow | It does not use contrib library <br>It is another way of making RNN |
| **04_seq2seq_keras** | Delayed RNN | Keras      | Predicting sin with delayed RNN in Keras |
